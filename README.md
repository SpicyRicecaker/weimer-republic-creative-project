# The Weimer Republic
- Why did it fail?


## Summary
- Initially after the war, everyone was very happy to be home
- In peace talks, everyone did not want another war. However, Germany wasn't even invited to the war, and the Treaty of Versailles declared that it was Germany's fault that the entire war happened 
  - Forced to pay huge amount of money to all the countries involved in the war
  - Forced to give up much of its territory

- As a result, many Germans saw the treaty of Versailles as something shameful, a sign of weakness, terms that were forced down their throat
- The theory evolved that Jews were backstabbers, and many Germans used them as scapegoats. The military didn't surrender but the government did, so many of the military leaders also blamed their civilian government for backstabbing them

- The Weimar republic was founded when the first Kaiser (basically was forcefully) abdicated, and democracy was declared by left-wing leaders basically without anyone really approving or asking of it. Founded in a really shaky time with a great deal of uncertainty, there wasn't a huge amount of support for it, (people just wanted stability)
  - Had a house of representatives, elected based on the population of each region, and also a senate that had seats that was elected via votes
  - Had a president that elected chancellor that elected ministers, who was elected by the people
  - Extremely progressive bill of rights and constitution that supported equal rights for all regardless of gender, race, social standing

- Possible problems with the weimar republic was that it was extremely hard to make decisions as there were a huge amount of minor parties in the house, so parties had to make coalitions to create a majority but then it would be hard for them to make clear and decisive laws
- Article 48 allowed the president (or was it chancellor?) to literaly bypass both houses "in times of danger", ignore civil rights declared in the bill of rights, and was regularly relied upon in 1930

- The people's already shaky belief in democracy combined with the fact that the leaders that most of them elected didn't pass clear laws and the president himself bypassing them all anyways weakened people's belief in a fair system and thus it was doomed to fail

- Enter the Nazi party, lead by Hitler who used the freedom of speech parts of a democracy to spread Nazi beliefs, openly opposing democracy, and yet gaining support because democracy wasn't popular at the time

- Finally, hyperinflation was also another huge influence that hit the economy hard, destroyed virtues of honest living for those who had lost everything, and opened up an avenue of extremism for all people that went through that period
